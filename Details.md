# Sunya FABLAB 
A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering digital fabrication.Fab Lab is the educational outreach component of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), an extension of its research into digital fabrication and computation. 
A Fab Lab is a platform for learning and innovation: a place to play, to create, to learn, to mentor, to invent.

To be a Fab Lab means connecting to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers, makers and innovators – a global knowledge sharing network that spans 30 countries and 24 time zones. 
A Fab Lab is comprised of off-the-shelf, industrial-grade fabrication and electronics tools, wrapped in open source software and programs written by researchers at MIT’s Center for Bits & Atoms.

Currently Fab Labs include a laser cutter that makes 2D and 3D structures, a sign cutter that plots in copper to make antennas and flex circuits, a high-resolution NC milling machine that makes circuit boards and precision parts, a large wood router for building furniture and housing, and a suite of electronic components and programming tools for low-cost, high-speed micro controllers for on-site rapid circuit prototyping. In schools, where Fab Labs are used as platforms for project-based, hands-on STEM education, users learn by designing and creating objects of personal interest or import. Empowered by the experience of making something themselves, they both learn and mentor each other, gaining deep knowledge about the machines, the materials, the design process, and the engineering that goes into invention and innovation.

In educational settings, rather than relying on a fixed curriculum, learning happens in an authentic, engaging, personal context – one in which students go through a cycle of imagination, design, prototyping, reflection, and iteration as they find solutions to challenges or bring their ideas to life.

To provide support for advanced technical education and a training path for new Fab Lab managers, Fab Academy, an internationally distributed campus for technical education, has emerged from the Fab Lab program. The Fab Academy provides instruction and supervises investigation of mechanisms, applications, and implications of digital fabrication.

In addition to Fab Academy, the network collaboration FabEd is being formed to provide support for formal education and resources for professional development for teachers and educators.

The FabEd collaboration is a coordinated effort led by The Fab Foundation and TIES, the Teaching Institute for Excellence in STEM, to build and support the movement of digital fabrication into formal education. We want to keep the magic and joy of what making and digital fabrication bring to the table and make that a part of learning.

Fab Labs are closely aligned with MIT’s Center for Bits & Atoms where research on next generation tools and software, as well as fabrication work flows and processes, is pushing up against digital-analog boundaries. CBA is charting a research road map that traverses the frontier of digital fabrication: from machines in a Fab Lab that make things, to machines that make parts of machines, to machines that self-reproduce, to building with digital materials, to materials that are programmable and can turn themselves into parts.

### Mini Fab Lab Equipments Details

## Laser Cutter
A laser cutter is a CO2 laser system utilized for the highest quality engraving and cutting of wood, acrylics, plastics etc. A vector image (.svg format) designed using any software can be fed to this machine to produce the required cutting and/or engraving. Two of its accessories are an air compressor and a blower.

The machine comes with a vector cutting table which enhances the cutting quality. Motion control provides high detailing quality. It has a switch panel with an LCD on top to enable manual control. After getting the image file from PC, job commands are given from this switch panel. A job can be selected from the list displayed on the LCD. Also axis can be adjusted manually from here. While giving print command from the PC, printer properties are adjusted according to the material used for cutting or engraving.

Speed and power requirements for cutting and engraving differ from material to material. The values for different materials are available in the epilog mini user’s manual. By adjusting the speed and power, colour images can be engraved. The machine supports up to six colours, each of which is assigned with a different speed and power.

A ShopBot Desktop is a CNC machine known for its woodworking capability. It has the precision,power and rigidity to produce machine parts from plastic, aluminium, and other materials as well.The Shopbot is generally used for 2D profiling, engraving, drilling and carving/milling. It comes bundled with specialized software for designing and tool path generation (CAD/CAM) VCarvePro ShopBot Edition.

It has a user friendly GUI that makes designing and creating tool paths an easy affair. The software can also be used purely for tool path generation (CAM).

It allows for data to be imported from a huge range of other design programs using a variety of industry standard file formats. These include DXF, EPS, AI and PDF files (if they contain vector data). The Shopbot Desktop is mainly used to create prototypes on wood, plastics and wax, precisely mill and cut Circuit Boards & engrave text onto wood and plastic to create boards.

## Vinyl Cutter

A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen. A vector-based design is created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well.

The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colours of vinyl. A design with multiple colours must have each colour cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colours, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a standalone cutter.The Roland GX-24 vinyl cutter/plotter offers enhanced speed,performance, reliability, precision and handling.

## 3D Printer

3D printers are very useful machines to own in a Fab Lab. 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.

Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another
electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file.

Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.

The term “3D printing” originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer.

Manufacturers are now proposing 3D printers for small prices. Home printers like Makerbot or Ultimaker are being used more and more in Fab Labs, because they are now more reliable and precise. The 3D printer will create your design layer by layer.
